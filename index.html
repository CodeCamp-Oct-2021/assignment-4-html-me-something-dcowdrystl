			<p class="funParagraph" id ="testP">As darkness falls after sunset, the corelings rise—demons who possess supernatural powers and burn with a consuming hatred of humanity. 
			   For hundreds of years the demons have terrorized the night, slowly culling the human herd that shelters behind magical wards—symbols of power 
			   whose origins are lost in myth and whose protection is terrifyingly fragile. It was not always this way. Once, men and women battled the corelings on equal terms, but those days are gone. 
			   Night by night the demons grow stronger, while human numbers dwindle under their relentless assault. Now, with hope for the future fading, 
			   three young survivors of vicious demon attacks will dare the impossible, stepping beyond the crumbling safety of the wards to risk everything in a desperate quest to regain the secrets of the past. 
			   Together, they will stand against the night.</p>

			<p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. 
				Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p>

			<p>	It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor 
				that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.</p>
				
			<p>	One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, 
				has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who 
				consider them expendable.</p>
				
			<p>	Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. 
				Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p>

			<img class="img-sm float-right img-border" src="./images/theBladeItself.jpg" />
			<p>Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he’s on the verge of becoming 
				a dead barbarian – leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies.</p>

			<p>	Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing 
				his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight 
				by altogether bloodier rules.</p>
				
			<p>	Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: 
				cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right 
				to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it.</p>
				
			<p>	Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, 
				he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult.</p>
				
			<p>	Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood.</p>

			<p>Guile is the Prism, the most powerful man in the world. He is high priest and emperor, a man whose power, wit, and charm are all that preserves a tenuous peace. 
				Yet Prisms never last, and Guile knows exactly how long he has left to live.</p>

			<p>When Guile discovers he has a son, born in a far kingdom after the war that put him in power, he must decide how much he's willing to pay to protect a secret 
				that could tear his world apart.</p>

			<p>This spring I'm looking forward to planting some new perennials to bloom in the summer, and I might try some seeds for annuals as well. I'll probably put some pretty annuals like begonias or geraniums in the pots on my porch for the summer. In the fall I plan to put some new tulip bulbs in the ground for the following spring. I look forward to seeing the results!</p>
